    <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
    <p>Cyber Security is the use of technology and processes to protect systems, networks and devices from cyber attacks. It is used to reduce the risk and damage caused by cyber attacks. Cyber security is important because it protects website data and user data. For the user this could be personal information like identifiable or health related information. Governments and companies also need to care about cyber security because they have intellectual property, data and industry informantion they need to protect.</p>
    <p>Cyber Security is more important then it has ever been. This is because we are now more reliant on technology than ever and it is only going to grow. A cyber attack can cause an incredible amount of damage now so cyber security is important to prevent that. Lots of businesses like banks or social media platforms get cyber attacks. Because of this they have to invest a lot into cyber security because a lot of user data is stored on cloud storage.  </p>
    <h2>Cyber Crime</h2>
    <p>There are many different types of cyber crime. The most common type of cyber crime is information theft. This is mainly because almost all valuable information is stored on a database. Information theft can be stealing someones account information or hacking into a company to leak information. The most common way hackers get into websites for this is through social engineering. They do this through using phishing links, spyware, ransomeware or even by calling them and trying to trick them into giving them access. </p>
    <p>Some people create malicious software like viruses. They create them to cause damage to peoples systems. They often create them as trojans meaning they appear as something they are not. Because of this they can quickly spread and people who aren't very knowledgeable on the topic will often not know their system has a virus. Another attack they can use is a Distributed Denial of Service attack otherwise known as a DDOS. This is when they have thousands of unique IPs try to connect to a server to overload it. A lot of the time the way they are able to get that many IPs is from a botnet which they can build by infecting peoples computers with viruses. </p>
